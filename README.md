Source code for the MODERNNORTHERN virtual art hall project. Will be updated the coming days.


## File Structure
The default version of this script supposes that one has a project folder, where most of the work will be done. This folder should contain a rhino file to work on and two sub folders called "Images" and "Exports". The "Images" folder should contain the images to be used in the exhibition and the "Exports" folder will contain the objects that are exported to Unreal or Unity.
